            Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream. From the first day we met, I knew you were someone
            special. Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your laughter is the sweetest melody I could ever hear.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through every season, every challenge, and every joy, you've been my constant. You've shown me what it means
            to truly love and be loved. With you, I've discovered a love that's deeper than words could ever express.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, on your special day, I want to celebrate not just you, but us. Thank you for being my greatest
            adventure, my safest place, and my forever love. Here's to many more birthdays together, many more memories
            to create, and a lifetime of loving you.
          </p>
